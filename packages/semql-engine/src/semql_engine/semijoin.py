"""Executor for a staged cross-backend semi-join.

:func:`semql.compile_semi_join_query` produces a :class:`SemiJoinPlan`: a set
of compiled inner plans plus a recipe for folding their results into an outer
query. This module drives the stages — run each inner, project its key column
to a de-duplicated value list, splice the lists into the outer query as
``in`` / ``not_in`` filters, then compile and run the outer.

Empty value lists are handled here, not at compile time, because the list is
only known after the inner runs:

- ``in`` over an empty list matches nothing — the whole query short-circuits
  to zero rows (a literal ``IN ()`` filter is invalid to compile anyway).
- ``not_in`` over an empty list restricts nothing — the filter is dropped.

NULL keys are dropped from every list: ``x IN (NULL)`` never matches and
would only bloat the list.
