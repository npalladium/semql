"""Qualified reference type and the single parser for ``"cube.field"`` refs.

A ``SemanticQuery`` names catalog fields as qualified strings — ``cube.field``.
This module is the one place that knows that convention: the shape check and
the split live here instead of being repeated at every use site.

A qualified ref is exactly ``<cube>.<field>`` — two SQL identifiers joined by
a single dot. Bare names and multi-dot output columns (e.g. compare facets)
are *not* qualified refs; :func:`local_name` is the tolerant read for the
paths that legitimately accept an already-unqualified field name.
