"""Cross-backend semi-join: staged value-list filtering.

A :class:`semql.spec.SemiJoin` restricts an outer dimension to the value set
produced by an inner query. Unlike a federated join, nothing crosses the
backend boundary as a join: the inner ``source`` runs first on its own
backend(s), its ``select`` column is projected to a de-duplicated literal
list, and that list is spliced into the outer query as an ``in`` / ``not_in``
``Filter``. The product is a :class:`SemiJoinPlan` — the compiled inner plans
plus a recipe (``bindings`` + ``bind_outer``) for folding their results into
the outer query.

Execution is inherently sequential (every inner runs before the outer can be
compiled, because the outer's ``IN`` list isn't known until the inner has
run), so this is *not* a single :class:`FederatedPlan`. The executor that
drives the stages lives in ``semql_engine`` (``run_semi_join``); this module
only compiles.

Type safety mirrors a cross-backend bridge join: the outer ``dimension`` and
the inner ``select`` dimension must share an accepted type (see
:func:`semql.federate._accepted_types` / ``Dimension.coerce_to``), or the
compiler refuses with ``cross_cube_type_coercion`` rather than shipping a
value list that the outer backend would silently coerce.
